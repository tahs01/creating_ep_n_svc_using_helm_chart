## Creating Endpoints and Service Using Helm Chart
**Helm is a package manager and orchestration tool for Kubernetes, a popular container orchestration platform. It simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes by providing a way to define, install, and upgrade applications as reusable "charts." A Helm chart is a collection of pre-configured Kubernetes resources (such as pods, services, and configmaps) packaged together with values that can be customized at deployment time.**

**In short, Helm streamlines the process of managing complex Kubernetes deployments by allowing users to define, version, and manage application components as Helm charts, enabling more efficient and consistent application deployment and management.**
